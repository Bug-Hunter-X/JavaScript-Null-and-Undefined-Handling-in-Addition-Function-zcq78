# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of `null` and `undefined` values in a simple addition function.  The `bug.js` file contains the original code, which only checks for `null`. The improved version in `bugSolution.js` handles both `null` and `undefined` values more robustly.
